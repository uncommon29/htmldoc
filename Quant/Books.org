46 awesome books for quant finance, algo trading, and market data analysis
One of the most common questions I get:

What books should I read for quant finance, algorithmic trading, and market data analysis?

And one of my favorite hobbies is collecting books on the subject.

46 awesome books for quant finance, algo trading, and market data analysis
46 books for quant finance, algo trading, and market data analysis. Books for quant finance, algorithmic trading, and market data analysis.
In today's newsletter, I captured books that I've read, studied, or used as a reference over the last 20 years. Each one has made an impact on me, one way or another.

While books are no substitute for practice, they help set the foundation of knowlege you can apply.

The better the book, the faster you can apply its lessons.

While some of these are dated, we benefit from the fact some foundations in math, time series analysis, and statistics don't change much over time.

I hope you enjoy the list.
